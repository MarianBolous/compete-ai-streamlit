## üèóÔ∏è Competitive Architecture

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Pattern
The platform implements a sophisticated **Plan ‚Üí Delegate ‚Üí Evaluate ‚Üí Iterate ‚Üí Finalize** architecture:

- **Orchestrator (Agentic Conductor)**: Central coordinator managing agent workflows with timeout handling and loop evaluation
- **Data Collection Agent**: Specialized intelligence gathering with multi-tool architecture and iterative refinement
- **AI Analysis Engine**: Advanced processing using multi-model routing and confidence scoring
- **UI Layer**: Real-time interface with progress callbacks and error handling

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. **Agent Delegation Strategy**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Data collection and analysis are handled by specialized agents
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Non-blocking operations with timeout management
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial results when components fail
- **Schema Stability**: Consistent data structures across all operations

#### 2. **Iterative Refinement Engine**
- **Coverage Thresholds**: "Stop-when-satisfied" criteria with configurable minimums
- **Confidence-Based Evaluation**: Dynamic quality assessment with retry logic
- **Loop Protection**: Maximum iteration limits with evaluation policies
- **Delta Tracking**: Change detection between analysis runs

#### 3. **Production-Ready Design**
- **Comprehensive Guardrails**: Timeouts, retries, rate limiting, and caching
- **Multi-Model Fallbacks**: OpenAI/Anthropic routing with automatic failover
- **Error Recovery**: Partial results and user-friendly error handling
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, connection pooling, and resource management

## üõ°Ô∏è Comprehensive Guardrails

### Timeout & Resource Management
- **Per-Agent Timeouts**: Configurable timeouts for data collection (15s) and analysis (45s)
- **Non-Blocking Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when components exceed time limits
- **Resource Pooling**: HTTP connection pooling with configurable pool sizes
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and resource deallocation

### Rate Limiting & API Protection
- **Token Bucket Rate Limiter**: Per-host rate limiting (30 calls/60 seconds)
- **Exponential Backoff**: Intelligent retry strategies with configurable backoff factors
- **API Key Rotation**: Support for multiple API keys with automatic failover
- **Request Throttling**: Adaptive throttling based on API response patterns

### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Comprehensive Retry Logic**: Handles connection, read, and status errors (429, 5xx)
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascade failures with automatic recovery
- **Partial Result Handling**: Returns useful data even when some components fail
- **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Clear error communication with recovery suggestions

### Caching & Performance
- **SQLite-Based Caching**: Persistent caching with configurable TTL (24 hours)
- **Embedding Cache**: Optimized similarity calculations with cache hits
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate API calls within time windows
- **Progressive Loading**: Incremental data loading with real-time progress updates

### Data Quality & Validation
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures data consistency across all operations
- **Confidence Scoring**: Per-section and overall confidence metrics
- **Source Attribution**: Full traceability of data sources and collection methods
- **Coverage Analysis**: Ensures minimum data requirements are met
